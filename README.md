# The Last Plex Plugin

Plex's supports for agents is on the way out, but I wanted a solution today, so I took inspiration from several other plugins on github and made my own. This repo is designed to hold more than one plugin, if needed.

**Inspiration**

- [ZeroQI's Youtube Agent](https://github.com/ZeroQI/YouTube-Agent.bundle)
- [JordyAlkema's Youtube-DL Agent](https://github.com/JordyAlkema/Youtube-DL-Agent.bundle)
- [TubeArchivist Plex Integration Agent](https://github.com/tubearchivist/tubearchivist-plex)
